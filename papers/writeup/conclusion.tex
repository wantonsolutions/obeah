In this paper we have presented Obeah, a tool for byzantine fault generation
using SMT guided fuzz testing. Obeah uses convenient automatic instrumentation
for learning control flow information, and adding logging annotation to
distributed systems written in Go. Obeah's profiles the control flow of running
systems and computes unlikely control flow paths. Using Z3, Obeah solves
constraints on the control flow. Satisfying assignments to control flow
constraints are applied to variables to mimic byzantine messages. Further we have
proposed a number of extensions to Obeah which would allow it to better reason
about the logic of a program, reduce false positives, help developers to triage
the source of faults, and reason about the control flow of other nodes in the
system.
